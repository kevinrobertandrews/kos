# kos — Kernel of Self

> _"A mirror made of state and will."_

`kos` is a personal operating system for your human life.  
A lightweight command-line interface to track, reflect, and act with intention.

This is not a productivity app.  
This is a system for designing your own agency, one stat at a time.

- ⏳ Apply time-based decay to show how needs change.
- 📜 Log meaningful actions and reflections.
